# Challenge Bravo

This API has mission to solve Challenge Bravo, where make exchanges between many currencies as necessary.

## Development
The code was written in Python 3.7 with following frameworks:
 - flask/flask-restfull: most popular to build web applications from python;
 - jsonschema: to validate contracts of request;
 - requests: package to make http request to external services;
 
 Frameworks necessary to unit tests:
 - pytest
 - parametrized
 - munch

To make a database, in my comprehension would be a over engineering use externals services. As our data was just currencies informations, could be easily storage at memory. But if necessary, I would use the redis db.
